/**
 * The Entropy class facilitates the generation and management of entropy data.
 * It provides functionality to extract a specific number of bits from an internal entropy source
 * and supports secure and system-clock-based entropy generation.
 * This class ensures the controlled use and extraction of entropy to avoid over-consumption.
 * The (singleton) `SecureRandom` instance is seeded from `/dev/urandom`.
 * NOTE the purpose of this class is pedagogical (i.e., for teaching).
 * In particular, it shows how you might use the raw bits from `SecureRandom` to satisfy requests for a random integer within a range.
 * In practice, you would probably the `nextInt(n)` method from `SecureRandom` directly.
