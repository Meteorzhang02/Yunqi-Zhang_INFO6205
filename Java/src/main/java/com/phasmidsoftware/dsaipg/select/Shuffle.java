/**
 * The `Shuffle` class provides utility methods for shuffling an array of objects.
 * It implements the Fisher-Yates (Knuth) shuffle algorithm to randomize the order of elements in the array.
 * NOTE that number of bits `B(n)` of entropy required for the shuffle is based on the length `n` of any given array.
 * Ideally, the number of bits is `lg n!` (approximately `n lg n - 1.44 n`)
 * In practice, however, because of wastage in the Knuth shuffle mechanism, the algorithm actually requires more.
 * The formula for n is derived as follows (where `k` represents a power of 2):
 * <ul>
 *     <li>`n = 2^k`</li>
 *     <li>`B(k) = (k-1)*n + 1`</li>
 * </ul>
 * Where `n` is not a power of 2, then an appropriate adjustment is made by counting down,
 * `k` at a time, from the value for the next higher power of k.
 * Here are some examples:
 * <dl>
 *     <dt>4</dt><dd>5 instead of 4</dd>
 *     <dt>6</dt><dd>11, instead of 6.87</dd>
 *     <dt>12</dt><dd>33, instead of 25.75</dd>
 *     <dt>52</dt><dd>249, instead of 221.5</dd>
 *     <dt>64</dt><dd>321, instead of 291.8</dd>
 * </dl>
