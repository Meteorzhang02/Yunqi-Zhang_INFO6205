 * Simple benchmarking tool: Stopwatch.

 * It is simply a convenient way to time an execution with results in milliseconds (the default),
 * microseconds, nanoseconds, or seconds.
 * <p>
 * Once the Stopwatch is started (i.e. constructed), you "read" the stopwatch by calling lap(),
 * which returns the number of time units since the previous lap (or since the start).
 * <p>NOTE that Stopwatch is not intended for long laps because it lacks the required precision
 * unless you use seconds as the time unit.</p>
